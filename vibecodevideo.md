Based on the video, here's a comprehensive list of things to add to your plugin development folder and considerations for updating your CLAUDE.md and other directions to get the best results from "vibe coding" (0:00):

Core Plugin Development Folder Structure:

The video demonstrates a structured approach to plugin development with AI. Your main plugin development folder (e.g., plugins as seen at 7:41) should contain:

Individual Plugin Folders: Each plugin you develop will have its own dedicated folder (e.g., shimmer reverb (9:10), 808 kick drum, clap, radio music).
create.sh script: This shell script (8:11) automates the creation of new plugin folders, copies a "new plugin skeleton" (8:19), renames instances of "new plugin skeleton" to the actual plugin name, copies in commands, and sets up other necessary files. This is a crucial time-saver.
new_plugin_skeleton template: This is a blank JUCE plugin canvas (8:22) that the create.sh script copies to start a new project.
Inside Each Individual Plugin Folder:

Each plugin folder will contain the core files and folders for that specific plugin:

JUCE Project Files: These are the essential files generated by the JUCE framework (5:40), including the .jucer file (9:21).
Source Folder: This contains your C++ source code files for the plugin (6:33).
Tests Folder: Contains the unit tests for your plugin (6:30), crucial for the test-driven development approach emphasized in the video (29:50).
Docs Folder: This folder (7:14) is where Claude will generate documentation and research.
Claude Folder (inside Docs): This is where your custom commands for Claude are stored (7:17, 10:51). The video details four main prompts:
1_juice_research.md (Research Command): This prompt (11:01) instructs Claude to classify the plugin idea, search and compile sources (tutorials, proven repos, recent papers, peer-reviewed papers), apply relevance, and create output files in a research subfolder.
2_juice_specification.md (Specification Command): This prompt (24:45) tells Claude to analyze the research, distill insights into a concise spec.md file, outlining the vision, purpose, functional requirements, technical architecture, and validation strategy.
3_juice_checklist.md (Checklist Command): This prompt (28:25) transforms the specification into a phase-based build checklist, detailing atomic subtasks for development and ensuring strict test-driven development.
4_juice_build.md (Build Command): This prompt (31:46) instructs Claude to execute every task in the checklist sequentially using strict TDD, mark tasks as complete, and commit changes.
CLAUDE.md Files and Global Rules:

The video highlights the critical role of CLAUDE.md files in providing context and rules for Claude's operations.

Repository-Level CLAUDE.md: (16:38) This file, located in the parent directory of your plugin folders, sets up rules for all projects within that directory. Key elements to include:

How to Contribute/Context Querying: Insist that Claude queries the Context 7 MCP server (17:12) for up-to-date, verified information before writing or modifying any code to prevent hallucinations. If data is insufficient, it should perform a detailed web search and cite sources.
Assumptions Note: Explicitly state that Claude should never assume how to implement or debug a feature without prior research via Context 7 (17:49).
JUCE Library ID: Include the JUCE library ID to save context requests (17:57).
Automatic Plugin Building and Movement: Instruct Claude to always build the JUCE plugin and move it to your specified VST3 folder (18:07) to save manual steps.
Continuous Validation Standard: This is a crucial section (19:00) to prevent wasted effort:
Smoke Stress Test: Implement a test that runs on every commit to check if the plugin can open without failure (19:04).
Audio Test: If possible, include an audio test where noise or a sine wave is pumped through the plugin to ensure expected behavior and no feedback (19:13).
CPU and Glitch Benchmark Test: (19:30)
UI Screenshot (if needed): (19:33)
Smoke Build Gate: (19:41) Provide tips on what to compile with.
Front-End Design Best Practices: Include a series of notes or a reference to research on JUCE front-end design (20:09) to ensure Claude builds aesthetically pleasing and functional UIs. This includes automated tests for overlapping elements, resizability, and correct application of colors and fonts (20:29).
Journal/Lessons Learned: A system for Claude to document what it learns about CPU glitch minimization or other development insights (20:51).
System-Wide CLAUDE.md (Optional but Recommended): (21:31) This even higher-level CLAUDE.md file can contain general instructions for Claude that apply across all your projects. Examples from the video include:

"We are colleagues," "Always call me lax" (21:39)
"Always use Context 7" (21:40)
General code writing and testing approaches (21:43)
Key Practices and Suggestions for Vibe Coding:

Claude Code in Terminal: The video heavily emphasizes using Claude Code directly in the terminal (4:50, 10:06) for super granular control over instructions.
"Dangerously Skip Permissions": The presenter uses this setting (10:08) to enable full automation without needing to confirm every action, allowing for a "set it and forget it" workflow (10:38). Use with caution.
Context 7 MCP Server Integration: This is fundamental (14:43, 17:12). Context 7 provides compiled documentation for software, frameworks, and languages (e.g., JUCE documentation), ensuring Claude has accurate information and doesn't hallucinate code.
Structured Prompting: The four-prompt system is key to guiding Claude effectively (7:20).
Test-Driven Development: This is a core methodology (29:50) enforced through the CLAUDE.md rules and checklist. Claude writes failing tests, then minimal code to pass them, then refactors. This ensures a robust and functional plugin.
Iterative Process: The video shows how Claude continuously works on tasks and updates the checklist, allowing you to leave it running (22:09, 33:40).
High-Quality Prompts: While the initial prompt for the shimmer reverb was simple (14:08), the underlying CLAUDE.md rules and the structured workflow enable better results.
Dedicated AI Plan: The presenter mentions a $200/month Claude Max plan (35:39) for consistent, all-day operation, highlighting the resource needs for extensive AI-driven development.
Learn Through Osmosis: Even without deep C++ knowledge, observing Claude's process helps in understanding concepts and frameworks (34:51).
By implementing these elements, you can create a highly efficient and automated workflow for developing VST plugins with AI.
